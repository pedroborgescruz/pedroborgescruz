### About me

* Born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Swarthmore College with passionate about problem-solving.
* I first fell in love with CS because of my love for mathematics, but I ultimately stuck around because of how technology can change people's lives.
* Outside of studying, building, and programming, I enjoy writing, going to the movies (and rating films on Letterboxd), and spending quality time with friends.
* I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am enthusiastic about learning new technology.
* How to reach me: pedroborgespc@gmail.com or pcruz1@swarthmore.edu.
