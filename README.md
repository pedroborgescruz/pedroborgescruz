### About me

* Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Swarthmore College with passionate about problem-solving. I first fell in love with CS because of my love for mathematics, but I ultimately stuck around because of how technology can change people's lives.
* As a computer scientist, I aim to learn from both industry and academia to drive innovation. I'm fascinated by how machine learning can break down language barriers in natural language applications. I'm also excited about the impact of fintech on everyday finances, the challenges of space communications, and the opportunity to build healthy, human-centered social media platforms.
* After graduating in May 2025, I'm hoping to work in the tech industry—whether at a large company or a smaller, mid-sized startup, as I’ve gained experience in both environments.
* Outside of studying, building, and programming, I enjoy writing, going to the movies (and rating films on Letterboxd), and spending quality time with friends.

- I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am enthusiastic about learning new technology.
